    <p>Hey, hey
      Bye bye bye, bye bye
      Bye bye
      
      I'm doing this tonight
      You're probably gonna start a fight
      I know this can't be right
      Hey baby come on
      I loved you endlessly
      When you weren't there for me
      So now it's time to leave and make it alone
      
      I know that I can't take no more
      It ain't no lie
      I want to see you out that door
      Baby <span>bye bye bye</span>
      
      Don't want to be a fool for you
      Just another player in your game for two
      You may hate me but it ain't no lie
      Baby bye bye bye
      Bye bye
      
      Don't really want to make it tough
      I just want to tell you that I've had enough
      It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
      Baby <span>bye bye bye</span>
      
      You just hit me with the truth
      Now girl you're more than welcome to
      So give me one good reason
      Baby come on
      I've lived for you and me
      And now I really come to see
      That life would be much better once you're gone
      
      I know that I can't take no more
      It ain't no lie
      I want to see you out that door
      Baby <span>bye bye bye</span>
      
      Don't want to be a fool for you
      Just another player in your game for two
      You may hate me but it ain't no lie
      Baby bye bye bye
      Bye bye
      Don't really want to make it tough
      I just want to tell you that I've had enough
      Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
      Baby <span>bye bye bye</span>
      
      I'm giving up I know for sure
      I don't' want to be the reason for your love no more
      Bye bye
      I'm checking out, I'm signing off
      I don't want to be the loser, and I've had enough
      
      I don't want to be your fool in this game for two
      So I'm leaving you behind
      (Bye bye bye)
      I don't want to make it tough
      (Make it tough)
      But I've had enough
      And it ain't no lie
      
      Don't want to be a fool for you
      Just another player in your game for two
      I don't want to be your fool
      But it ain't no lie
      Baby bye bye bye
      Bye bye
      Don't really want to make it tough
      I just want to tell you that I've had enough
      It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
      
      <span>bye bye bye</span>
