  <p>Hey, hey<br>
    Bye bye bye, bye bye<br>
    Bye bye<br>
    <br>
    I'm doing this tonight<br>
    You're probably gonna start a fight<br>
    I know this can't be right<br>
    Hey baby come on<br>
    I loved you endlessly<br>
    When you weren't there for me<br>
    So now it's time to leave and make it alone<br>
    <br>
    I know that I can't take no more<br>
    It ain't no lie<br>
    I want to see you out that door<br>
    Baby <br><span>bye bye bye</span><br>
    <br>
    Don't want to be a fool for you<br>
    Just another player in your game for two<br>
    You may hate me but it ain't no lie<br>
    Baby bye bye bye<br>
    Bye bye<br>
    <br>
    Don't really want to make it tough<br>
    I just want to tell you that I've had enough<br>
    It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie<br>
    Baby <br><span>bye bye bye</span><br>
    <br>
    You just hit me with the truth<br>
    Now girl you're more than welcome to<br>
    So give me one good reason<br>
    Baby come on<br>
    I've lived for you and me<br>
    And now I really come to see<br>
    That life would be much better once you're gone<br>
    <br>
    I know that I can't take no more<br>
    It ain't no lie<br>
    I want to see you out that door<br>
    Baby <br><span>bye bye bye</span><br>
    <br>
    Don't want to be a fool for you<br>
    Just another player in your game for two<br>
    You may hate me but it ain't no lie<br>
    Baby bye bye bye<br>
    Bye bye<br>
    Don't really want to make it tough<br>
    I just want to tell you that I've had enough<br>
    Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie<br>
    Baby<br><span>bye bye bye</span><br>
    <br>
    I'm giving up I know for sure<br>
    I don't' want to be the reason for your love no more<br>
    Bye bye<br>
    I'm checking out, I'm signing off<br>
    I don't want to be the loser, and I've had enough<br>
    <br>
    I don't want to be your fool in this game for two<br>
    So I'm leaving you behind<br>
    (Bye bye bye)<br>
    I don't want to make it tough<br>
    (Make it tough)<br>
    But I've had enough<br>
    And it ain't no lie<br>
    <br>
    Don't want to be a fool for you<br>
    Just another player in your game for two<br>
    I don't want to be your fool<br>
    But it ain't no lie<br>
    Baby bye bye bye<br>
    Bye bye<br>
    Don't really want to make it tough<br>
    I just want to tell you that I've had enough<br>
    It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie<br>
